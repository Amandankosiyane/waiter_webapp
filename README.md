# waiter_webapp

## About
My sister owns a restaurant, so she asked me to build her a web-Application that will allow her waiters to select the days that they would like to work on.

She also want to see the available waiters per day.

## Waiters are able to:
- Enter their name in the URL(the URL page will redirect them to a page where they will select the days).
- Select 3 working days.
Also update their working days.

## Admin will be able to:
- See available waiter per day.
- Reset schedule for the following week.
- See the days that have less, enough or more waiters.
- See the background-color changes when there are enough(background-color should be green), more(background-color should be orange) and less waiters(background-color should be red).

## Let's start
- Clone my [repository](https://github.com/Amandankosiyane/waiter_webapp/tree/master) from github to your machine.
- Copy and paste the following code to your terminal:
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/Amandankosiyane/waiter_webapp.git.

```
- Before you start anything you first need to make sure that you have the following _installed:_
> NodeJS.
> MongoDB.
> Package.JSON dependencies.
### Installation:
###### NodeJS
- First check if you have NodeJS installed in your machine by typing _node -v_. if you already have NodeJS, your terminal will show you the version of NodeJS that you have. If you do not have NodeJS installed, then install it in your terminal following [these](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04) commands.
