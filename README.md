# waiter_webapp

## About
My sister owns a restaurant, so she asked me to build her a web-Application that will allow her waiters to select the days that they would like to work on.

She also want to see the available waiters per day.

## Waiters are able to:
- Enter their name in the URL(the URL page will redirect them to a page where they will select the days).
- Select 3 working days.
Also update their working days.

## Admin will be able to:
- See available waiter per day.
- Reset schedule for the following week.
- See the days that have less, enough or more waiters.
- See the background-color changes when there are enough(background-color should be green), more(background-color should be orange) and less waiters(background-color should be red).

## Let's start
- Clone my [repository](https://github.com/Amandankosiyane/waiter_webapp/tree/master) from github to your machine.
- Copy and paste the following code to your terminal:
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/Amandankosiyane/waiter_webapp.git.

```
- Before you start anything you first need to make sure that you have the following _installed:_
> NodeJS.

> MongoDB.

> Package.JSON dependencies.

### Installation:
###### NodeJS
- First check if you have NodeJS installed in your machine by typing **node -v**. if you already have NodeJS, your terminal will show you the version of NodeJS that you have. If you do not have NodeJS installed, then install it in your terminal following [these](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04) commands.
###### MongoDB
- Click [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04) to get guidance on how to install mongoDB, **NB:** do part 1 only.
###### Package.JSON dependencies
- Since you already have Package.JSON file, you need to install the dependencies by typing the following command:
```
npm install

```
- Now that you have installed your dependencies JSON file should look like this:
```javascript

{
  "name": "waiter_webapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.17.2",
    "express": "^4.15.4",
    "express-flash": "0.0.2",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.0.0",
    "express-session": "^1.15.5",
    "mongoose": "^4.11.8"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


```
## Let's run the Application locally
- If you installed everything correctly by now you should be able to run the Application locally.
- In your terminal type the following command:
```
- nodemon
or
- node index.js

```
- If you do not have errors you should see this in your terminal(in my case i used nodemon to run the Application):
```
[nodemon] 1.11.0
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
`open()` is deprecated in mongoose >= 4.11.0, use `openUri()` instead, or set the `useMongoClient` option if using `connect()` or `createConnection()`. See http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#use-mongo-client
express-session deprecated undefined resave option; provide resave option index.js:20:9
express-session deprecated undefined saveUninitialized option; provide saveUninitialized option index.js:20:9
web app started on port: 3016

```
- Run the Application in the browser by typing in the localhost number:
```
http://localhost:3016

```
- Then you should land to this page:
