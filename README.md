# waiter_webapp

## About
My sister owns a restaurant, so she asked me to build her a web-Application that will allow her waiters to select the days that they would like to work on.

She also want to see the available waiters per day.

## Waiters are able to:
- Enter their name in the URL(the URL page will redirect them to a page where they will select the days).
- Select 3 working days.
Also update their working days.

## Admin will be able to:
- See available waiter per day.
- Reset schedule for the following week.
- See the days that have less, enough or more waiters.
- See the background-color changes when there are enough(background-color should be green), more(background-color should be orange) and less waiters(background-color should be red).

## Let's start
Clone my [repository](https://github.com/Amandankosiyane/waiter_webapp/tree/master) from github to your machine.
